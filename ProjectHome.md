This is basically the standard Progressbar, just vertical. When setting the value of the progressbar you can also set the width and height.

To use:
Add the following JavaScript along with the rest of your jQuery scripts.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="ui.progressbarVertical_1.0.0.js">

Unknown end tag for &lt;/script&gt;

```

To create a vertical progress bar :
```

$("#progressbarVertical-1").progressbarVertical({
value: 87,
width: 15,
height: 150,
});
```

The width and height are optional.The default width is 20, and the default height is 300.

Style as you would style the progressbar.

This is my first plugin, so any comments/fixes are welcome.

Enjoy!
